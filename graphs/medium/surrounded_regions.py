"""
You are given a 2-D matrix board containing 'X' and 'O' characters.
If a continous, four-directionally connected group of 'O's is surrounded by 'X's, it is considered to be surrounded.
Change all surrounded regions of 'O's to 'X's and do so in-place by modifying the input board.
Example 1:
Input: board = [
  ["X","X","X","X"],
  ["X","O","O","X"],
  ["X","O","O","X"],
  ["X","X","X","O"]
]
Output: [
  ["X","X","X","X"],
  ["X","X","X","X"],
  ["X","X","X","X"],
  ["X","X","X","O"]
]
