"""
You are given an 2-D array points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents the coordinates of a point on an X-Y axis plane. You are also given an integer k.Return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).
The distance between two points is defined as the Euclidean distance (sqrt((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2)).
You may return the answer in any order.
Example 1:
Input: points = [[0,2],[2,2]], k = 1
Output: [[0,2]]
