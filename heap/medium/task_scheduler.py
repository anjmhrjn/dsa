"""
You are given an array of CPU tasks tasks, where tasks[i] is an uppercase english character from A to Z. You are also given an integer n.
Each CPU cycle allows the completion of a single task, and tasks may be completed in any order.
The only constraint is that identical tasks must be separated by at least n CPU cycles, to cooldown the CPU.
Return the minimum number of CPU cycles required to complete all tasks.
Example 1:
Input: tasks = ["X","X","Y","Y"], n = 2
Output: 5
