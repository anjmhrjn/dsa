"""
Given a 2-D grid of characters board and a list of strings words, return all words that are present in the grid.
For a word to be present it must be possible to form the word with a path in the board with horizontally or vertically neighboring cells. The same cell may not be used more than once in a word.
Example 1:
Input:
board = [
  ["a","b","c","d"],
  ["s","a","a","t"],
  ["a","c","k","e"],
  ["a","c","d","n"]
],
words = ["bat","cat","back","backend","stack"]
Output: ["cat","back","backend"]
