"""
Given the root of a non-empty binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.
A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes has an edge connecting them. A node can not appear in the sequence more than once. The path does not necessarily need to include the root.
The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.
Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 6
